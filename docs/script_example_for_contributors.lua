[Concisely describe what the script does here. Each line should be a
maximum of 79 characters long. If you don't have a ruler set in your
text editor, just upload it and I'll fix it.

Make sure to break up your description into multiple lines.

This library is meant to be perused by absolute beginners, so don't be
afraid to over-explain things. If you're not sure what to write, just
look at some of the other scripts and copy their format.

If your code is particularly complicated, you can and should add
comments within the code block below. However, if it's just a few lines,
you can just describe it here and leave the code clean.

Please prefer descriptive variable names over comments. For example,
instead of writing: 

    -- This variable is the increment
    local incr = hzIn[i] / sampleRate

You should write:

    local increment = hzIn[i] / sampleRate

If you're REALLY lazy and don't want to write a description, you can 
just upload it and I'll add one ;) If I have any questions about how it
works, I'll ask you.]

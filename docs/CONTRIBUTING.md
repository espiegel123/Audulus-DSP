# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Audulus DSP node Lua code library! The more contributors we have, the more useful this library will be for everyone.

## How to contribute

To contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the project repository to your own account.
1. Create a new branch for your changes.
1. Make your changes in the branch.
1. Test your changes to make sure they work as expected.
1. Submit a pull request from your branch to the project repository.

If adding a new script, please follow the [style guide](/docs/script_example_for_contributors.lua). Also remember to upload an Audulus patch that demonstrates the script's functionality.

## What to contribute

We welcome contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code changes.

Before making a contribution, please review the existing issues and pull requests to make sure that your contribution has not already been suggested or implemented.

If you're not sure whether your contribution is appropriate or how best to implement it, please open an issue to discuss it with the project maintainers.

## Code style and formatting

Please follow the existing code [style and formatting conventions](/docs/script_example_for_contributors.lua) in the project. If your changes require changes to the project's style or formatting, please include those changes in your pull request.

## Testing

Please test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request. The most obvious test would be to run your code in Audulus and make sure it works as expected. This is why it's also encouraged that you upload a patch that demonstrates the script's functionality.

## Code reviews

All pull requests will be reviewed by project maintainers before they are merged. The maintainers may request changes to the code or documentation, or ask for additional information or testing.

Please be patient during the review process and be willing to make changes or address issues raised by the maintainers.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors to the project are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Any behavior that violates the Code of Conduct may result in the contributor being banned from contributing to the project.
